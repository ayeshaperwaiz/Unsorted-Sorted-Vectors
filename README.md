The following are implementations of search algorithms to create a concordance based on the
following data structures: unsorted vector and sorted vectors. 

An unsorted vector is expected to run at O(𝑛^2) as it traverses through each time. A sorted vector has time complexity of O(n)
because we can iterate through the vector and compare the elements with the next element to find the
occurrence. Compared to sorted vectors, unsorted vectors are significantly slower because comparisons
are made against each and every element in the vector.
